## About

Hey there! Iâ€™m a Software developer working at Refyne a fin-tech startup from India. In my free time I like read and implement research papers, explore FP and play games (Steam/Switch).

This blog is a digital repository where I intent to share and document the different things I explore from cooking - software - DIY - games. My hobbies include reading, cooking, games and game-design. Most of my personal projects can be found on github. You can also follow me on steam.

I also like to go on hikes and treks. The two major treks I have been to include KGL(Kashmir Great Lakes) and RoopKund.

Also, feel free to schedule a call with me
if you want to talk about tech, programming, open source, movies, books, games, game-design, philosophy and everything in between :)
